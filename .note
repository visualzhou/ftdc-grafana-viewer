## Implementation Progress

### Initial Limitations (Pre-Phase 1)
The initial implementation of the FTDC importer had several critical limitations:

1. **Incomplete Binary Data Processing**: Failed to properly handle compressed metric chunks in binary fields
2. **Missing Array Support**: Did not process array elements, missing metrics like `hostInfo_extra_mountInfo_X_major`
3. **Incomplete Document Type Handling**: Did not properly handle MetadataDelta documents
4. **Limited BSON Type Support**: Only extracted metrics from Double, Int32, and Int64 types

### Phase 1 Improvements (Completed)
We made significant improvements to the FTDC importer:

1. **Enhanced Binary Data Processing**:
   - Added `process_binary_data()` function to decompress and parse binary data
   - Implemented schema document parsing for compressed chunks
   - Added support for metric chunks with timestamps

2. **Array Element Processing**:
   - Added support for extracting metrics from array elements
   - Implemented proper naming for array elements (using index suffixes)

3. **Better Document Type Handling**:
   - Improved handling of Metadata documents
   - Added proper support for MetadataDelta documents
   - Enhanced Metric document processing

4. **Expanded BSON Type Support**:
   - Added support for Boolean values
   - Improved handling of nested documents
   - Added proper type conversion for all supported types

### Phase 2 Improvements (Completed)
We've addressed the critical components of the FTDC format:

1. **Column-Oriented Processing**:
   - ✅ Implemented recursive extraction of numeric values from documents
   - ✅ Added proper mapping between field names and values
   - ✅ Created direct metric creation from column-oriented data
   - ✅ Improved handling of arrays and nested documents

2. **Complete Decompression Pipeline**:
   - ✅ Replaced ZSTD with ZLIB
   - ✅ Implemented varint decompression
   - ✅ Added run-length decoding of zeros
   - ✅ Implemented delta decoding
   - ✅ Added reference value support for baselines

3. **Reference Document Handling**:
   - ✅ Properly extracted reference values from metadata documents
   - ✅ Used reference values as baselines for delta decoding
   - ✅ Added fallback mechanisms for corrupt data

4. **Enhanced BSON Type Support**:
   - ✅ Added better type inference based on field names and value ranges
   - ✅ Improved handling of Boolean, DateTime, and Timestamp values
   - ✅ Implemented proper type conversion between u64 and various BSON types

5. **Memory Allocation Improvements**:
   - ✅ Added safety checks to prevent excessive memory allocation
   - ✅ Implemented graceful fallbacks for unreasonable values
   - ✅ Fixed memory allocation errors with large zero counts

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **MetadataDelta Reconstruction**:
   - Implement the reconstruction algorithm for metadata deltas
   - Ensure proper handling of field changes over time

2. **Clean Up Debug Output**:
   - Remove or conditionally enable verbose logging
   - Add configuration option for debugging level

3. **Additional Testing**:
   - Test with more diverse FTDC files
   - Verify correctness of column-oriented processing
   - Add comprehensive tests for edge cases

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add benchmarking for key functions
   - Optimize memory usage during decompression
   - Implement more efficient parsing algorithms

2. **Documentation**:
   - Add API documentation
   - Create usage examples
   - Document the FTDC format comprehensively
   - Add detailed comments for complex algorithms

### Low Priority
1. **Additional Features**:
   - Add support for metric filtering
   - Implement metric aggregation
   - Add support for custom metric names

2. **CLI Improvements**:
   - Add progress reporting
   - Add configuration options for debug level

## Dependencies
Current key dependencies:
- ✅ libflate: For ZLIB compression (replaced zstd)
- bson: For document parsing
- tokio: For async support
- serde: For serialization
- thiserror: For error handling
- futures: For streaming support
- reqwest: For HTTP client
- structopt: For CLI argument parsing

## Notes
- The implementation now correctly processes the MongoDB FTDC format
- We've addressed the column-oriented nature of the FTDC data
- We've implemented the complete decompression pipeline
- We've added robust error handling for corrupt data
- We need to implement MetadataDelta reconstruction
- We should clean up debug output for production use

# FTDC VarInt Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Extracted Standalone VarInt Module**
   - Created new `src/varint.rs` module with proper documentation
   - Implemented encode/decode functions that match MongoDB's FTDC format
   - Added to `lib.rs` and removed inline implementation from `ftdc_decoder.rs`

2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Created extensive test suite covering various edge cases
   - Added direct equivalents of MongoDB's original C++ tests:
     - `test_mongodb_int_compression` (tests bit patterns, powers of 2)
     - `test_mongodb_multiple_zeros` (tests sequence encoding)
   - Verified correctness with known encodings and binary patterns

3. **Integration with FTDC Decoder**
   - Updated the FTDC decoder to use the new module
   - All tests pass, confirming compatibility with the existing code

## Notes
- The implementation follows Google's Protocol Buffer varint encoding
- Maximum encoding size for uint64 is 10 bytes
- Zero-value run-length encoding works correctly with the new implementation
