# FTDC Importer Development Notes

## Current Implementation (Phase 1)

### Core Components

1. FTDC Parser (`src/lib.rs`)
   - Handles BSON document parsing
   - Extracts timestamps and metrics
   - Supports basic error handling
   - ✅ Supports multiple metric types (Double, Int32, Int64)
   - ✅ Implements proper type conversion to f64
   - ✅ Includes comprehensive tests for each type
   - ✅ Supports nested document structures with recursive processing
   - ✅ Implements hierarchical metric naming
   - ✅ Fixed variable mutability warnings

2. FTDC Reader (`src/reader.rs`)
   - ✅ Implements async file reading
   - ✅ Handles different FTDC document types (Metadata, Metric, MetadataDelta)
   - ✅ Supports reference-based document model
   - ✅ Provides streaming API for efficient processing
   - ✅ Includes proper error handling for malformed files

3. Compression Module (`src/compression.rs`)
   - Implements ZSTD decompression
   - Includes basic error handling
   - Tested with valid and invalid data
   - ✅ Code cleanup and organization improvements

4. Victoria Metrics Integration (`src/victoria_metrics.rs`)
   - ✅ Implements conversion to InfluxDB Line Protocol
   - ✅ Creates HTTP client for Victoria Metrics
   - ✅ Adds batch processing support
   - ✅ Includes proper error handling
   - ✅ Tested with mock HTTP server

5. CLI Application (`src/main.rs`)
   - ✅ Implements command-line interface
   - ✅ Supports file path and Victoria Metrics URL parameters
   - ✅ Includes batch size configuration
   - ✅ Provides verbose output option
   - ✅ Reports processing statistics
   - ✅ Implements check mode for analyzing entire FTDC files
   - ✅ Refactored to separate check mode and import mode functions

### Test Coverage
- Basic parser creation and initialization
- Valid document parsing with metrics
- ZSTD compression/decompression
- Error handling for invalid data
- ✅ Type-specific tests for Int32, Int64, and Double metrics
- ✅ Edge case handling for unsupported types
- ✅ Integration tests with real FTDC files
- ✅ Verification of document structure and metrics
- ✅ Tracking of unique metrics and document counts
- ✅ Victoria Metrics client testing with mock HTTP server
- ✅ Line protocol conversion testing
- ✅ Fixed test assertions for line protocol format

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. ✅ Support for Different Metric Types
   - ✅ Added support for Int32, Int64, and Double types
   - ✅ Implemented proper type conversion
   - ✅ Added tests for each metric type
   - ✅ Added error handling for unsupported types

2. ✅ File Reading and Streaming
   - ✅ Implemented async file reading
   - ✅ Added support for large files
   - ✅ Implemented proper buffering
   - ✅ Created streaming API for efficient processing

3. ✅ Real FTDC File Testing
   - ✅ Created test fixtures with real FTDC files
   - ✅ Added integration tests
   - ✅ Verified document structure and metrics

4. ✅ Victoria Metrics Integration
   - ✅ Implemented conversion to InfluxDB Line Protocol
   - ✅ Created HTTP client for Victoria Metrics
   - ✅ Added batch processing support
   - ✅ Added proper error handling
   - ✅ Created integration tests with mock HTTP server

### Medium Priority
1. Performance Optimization
   - Add benchmarking
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Profile and improve parsing speed

2. Error Handling Improvements
   - Add more specific error types
   - Improve error messages
   - Add error recovery mechanisms

3. Documentation
   - Add API documentation
   - Create usage examples
   - ✅ Document the FTDC format (added to README.md)
   - ✅ Add usage instructions to README.md

### Low Priority
1. Additional Features
   - Add support for metric filtering
   - Implement metric aggregation
   - Add support for custom metric names
   - ✅ Add check mode for inspecting FTDC files

2. CLI Improvements
   - ✅ Add progress reporting
   - ✅ Implement verbose logging
   - ✅ Add configuration options
   - ✅ Add check mode

## Technical Debt
1. ✅ Clean up unused imports
   - ✅ Remove `UNIX_EPOCH` from lib.rs
   - ✅ Move `Write` to test module in compression.rs
   - ✅ Remove unused imports from reader.rs
   - ✅ Remove unused imports from compression.rs
   - ✅ Remove unused `SystemTime` import from victoria_metrics_tests.rs
   - ✅ Fixed variable mutability warnings in lib.rs

2. Code Organization
   - ✅ Refactored main.rs to separate check mode and import mode functions
   - Consider splitting parser into smaller modules
   - Add proper module documentation
   - Improve code reusability

## Dependencies
Current key dependencies:
- zstd: For compression
- bson: For document parsing
- tokio: For async support
- serde: For serialization
- thiserror: For error handling
- futures: For streaming support
- reqwest: For HTTP client
- structopt: For CLI argument parsing

## Notes

- All tests are passing, including integration tests with real FTDC files
- Comprehensive error handling is in place
- The FTDC format has been thoroughly documented in the README.md
- The code successfully handles nested document structures and different document types
- The implementation is ready for integration with Victoria Metrics 
- The CLI application provides a user-friendly interface for importing FTDC files 
- All linter warnings have been addressed and fixed
